## The Challenge

Build an API with the following:

- Endpoints
  - PUT /:student-id/:propertyName(/:propertyName)
    - Stores data within `/data/${studentId}.json`.
    - If that file or property doesn't exist it is created.
    - Should also set nested properties: `curl -X PUT -d '{ "score": 98 }' http://localhost:1337/rn1abu8/courses/calculus/quizzes/ye0ab61` would mean that `require('./data/rn1abu8.json').courses.calculus.quizzes.ye0ab61.score === 98`
  - GET /:student-id/:propertyName(/:propertyName)
    - Retrieves data from `/data/${studentId}.json`. Returns 404 if that file or property doesn't exist.
    - Should also retrieve nested properties: `curl http://localhost:1337/rn1abu8/courses/calculus`
  - DELETE /:student-id/:propertyName(/:propertyName)
    - Removes data from `/data/${studentId}.json`. Returns 404 if that file or 
    property doesn't exist.
    - Should also remove nested properties.
- Tests
  - Each endpoint should have its own test
